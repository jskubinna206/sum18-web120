            	<h2>Welcome to my WEB 120 portal page.</h2>
                <p>This is my second quarter of my computer programming / web development and I am excited to see what new things I will learn this quarter. Feel free to check in periodically to see what new projects have been added.</p>
                <p>My final project is a website for my good friend who is looking to showcase his tattoo art. My personal hobbies currently include learning the banjo, beadwork, and making other jewelry.</p>
                <p>This is a simple change to illustrate my third commit for github.</p>
